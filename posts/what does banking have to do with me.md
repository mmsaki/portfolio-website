## Exploring my interests in banks and whether the system works

Today I missed an interview with the Association for Black Economic Power (ABEP), and I'm disappointed because I had a vision for a new kind of banking system that could make a real difference for underserved communities around the world. This isn't just another credit union or lending product - it's a revolutionary way to improve banking interactions and make finance more accessible for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting project.

In the United States, banks are subject to oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and other regulatory agencies. In order to operate, a bank must be approved for a federal or state charter, and must obtain approval for deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Banks must also comply with capital adequacy guidelines set by their primary federal regulator. The OCC has the exclusive authority to issue federal charters, and will only grant a charter if it believes the bank has a reasonable chance of success and will operate in a safe and sound manner.

Starting a bank is a complex process with many requirements. Banks must demonstrate that they have sufficient capital to support their operations, risk profile, and future growth, even in the face of potential losses. New banks are typically subject to additional criteria until their operations become well-established and profitable.

A lot of what banks do is developing a risk management system for their organization. They typically apply for a federal or state charter, which allows them to operate as a bank and offer banking services. They must also obtain approval for deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in order to accept deposits from customers. Banks may use demographic information to determine which products and services to offer, such as checking and savings accounts, mortgage loans, and commercial loans. They may also offer online banking services and hire employees to work at the bank. However, purchasing a physical location and holding an opening ceremony are not necessarily required for starting a bank.

I think banking systems are great and they work. As a new generation coming into the financial industry, you need to think of ways to adapt if you ar coming with a new vision. However appropriate, you must make sure that you spend extensive time reasearching and quizing yourself about how things have been operating. Often times a good book and documentation goes a long way.

I as I continue my research I will write about my findings and quiz my knowledge. As of now I will keep collecting anything I find to help me get to this goal to help me make banking easier for people to understand. My guess is that cryptocurrencies are coming with a better product for a global economy to serve and will boost banking as a whole. If i'm buidling anything to improve banking as a whole it's going to be centered around customers using web3 (blochain interactions) and allowing traditional banks to continue operating as they should.
