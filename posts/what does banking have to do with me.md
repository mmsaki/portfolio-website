## How does banking work?

Today I missed an interview with the Association for Black Economic Power (ABEP), and I'm disappointed because I had a vision to make a real difference for underserved communities here in Minneapolis and around the world. I think public goods can extend to credit unions or banking - it's a revolutionary way to improve banking interactions and make finance more accessible for everyone.

In the United States, banks are regulated by the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)](https://www.occ.treas.gov/index.html) and other agencies. For example, banks with assets greater than $10 billion may be regulated by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), and state-chartered banks may be regulated by state banking agencies. Banks may also be subject to regulation by other agencies depending on their activities, such as the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/) for securities activities or the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) for consumer financial products and services.

In order to operate, banks must obtain a federal or state charter and approval for deposit insurance from the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](https://www.fdic.gov/). Additionally, banks must adhere to capital adequacy guidelines set by their primary federal regulator. The OCC is the sole authority for issuing federal charters, and will only grant a charter if it determines that the bank has a viable chance of success and will operate in a safe and sound manner.

Starting a bank is a complex process with many requirements. Banks must demonstrate that they have sufficient capital to support their operations, risk profile, and future growth, even in the face of potential losses. New banks are typically subject to additional criteria until their operations become well-established and profitable.

A lot of what banks do is developing a risk management system for their organization. They typically apply for a federal or state charter, which allows them to operate as a bank and offer banking services. They must also obtain approval for deposit insurance from the FDIC in order to accept deposits from customers. Banks may use demographic information to determine which products and services to offer, such as checking and savings accounts, mortgage loans, and commercial loans. They may also offer online banking services and hire employees to work at the bank. However, purchasing a physical location and holding an opening ceremony are not necessarily required for starting a bank.

Banking systems can be effective and efficient ways to manage financial transactions and provide financial services to individuals and businesses. However, as a new generation enters the financial industry, it is important to consider how to adapt to changing circumstances and stay current with industry developments. This may involve researching and learning about how the industry has evolved and how it currently operates, as well as seeking out resources like books and documentation that can provide insights and guidance. It is essential to spend time learning about the industry and gaining a thorough understanding of its processes and practices in order to effectively contribute and make informed decisions.

As I continue my research, I will document my findings and assess my knowledge. I am currently gathering information that will help me improve the accessibility and understanding of banking for individuals. I believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to enhance the global economy and the banking industry as a whole. In my efforts to improve banking, I plan to focus on enabling customers to use web3 (blockchain interactions) while allowing traditional banks to function as intended.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting project.
