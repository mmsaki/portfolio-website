## State of Afro Radio

It's been a while since I put pen to paper, but today i'm feeling inspired! As I look back on my life so far, I'm grateful for the times I've pushed through tough situations and maintained a relatively organized life. But I know I can still do better, and that means no more engaging in activities that don't benefit me. Here's to a new chapter and a fresh start!

I'm determined to make the rest of the year my best yet! I want to enjoy my time more, connect with friends, and plan my days with purpose. Sure, I get excited and sometimes that energy can be overwhelming, but I won't let it stop me from pursuing my ideas, plans, and business goals. I'm taking control and making this my year.

Starting Afro Radio in 2020 was an incredible blessing i'm excited to continue growing and developing the idea. I want to do everything I can to make Afro Radio even better, so stay tuned for updates and exciting new developments.

As I approach this year, I hope I can reach to these realizations of building a product for Afro Radio and have a visual representation of what it can be. Stay tuned.
