## My journey to building a business based on innovation

### MOVING BEYOND THE SUPERFICIAL

As a young entrepreneur, I was always fascinated by the way that celebrities and social media influencers seemed to have such a huge impact on the world of business. From designer clothes to luxury watches, it seemed like everything these people touched turned to gold.

At first, I couldn't help but be envious of their success. I wanted to be just like them, using my image and influence to create hype and value for whatever product I was promoting. So, I decided to follow their lead and start promoting products on my own social media accounts.

But as I delved deeper into the world of the culture economy, I began to realize that a lot of the products I was promoting were actually pretty unimportant. Sure, they might have been fashionable or trendy, but they didn't really serve any real purpose beyond that.

As I started to see more and more young people copying this model, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. These people were blindly following the hype, without really understanding how the financial world worked or what they were doing.

It wasn't until I took a step back and started to think about the world in a different way that I realized the cultural economy was actually kind of outdated. It was based on hype and image, rather than genuine technical innovation and real value.

So, I made the decision to start over and develop my own business ideas. I wanted to create something that was truly innovative and would stand the test of time, rather than just riding the waves of hype and fashion.

And that's how I ended up starting my own blog. I wanted to create a platform where I could share my own unique ideas and insights, rather than just promoting someone else's products. It was a tough decision, but in the end, it was worth it.

Now, I'm building a business that is based on genuine value and technical innovation, rather than just chasing the latest trends. And as I look around at all the young people who are still stuck in the cultural economy, I can't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I may not be as flashy or fashionable as some of the other influencers out there, but I know that what I'm doing is truly important and meaningful.
