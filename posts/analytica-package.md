## Introduction

I started this project as a practical implementation of financial calcutions I learned while attending a financial technology course in March 2022. This is a way for me to go back an revisit all the financial calculations I learned at the begining of my class.

## Demonstration

The goal of this project is to combine different financial calcutions and abstract them for reuse in various projects. I have made a short demo showing how to use the package.
