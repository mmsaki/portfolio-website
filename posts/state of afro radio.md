## State of Afro Radio

It's been a while since I put pen to paper, but today is August 29th and I'm feeling inspired! Next month marks my birthday, and as I look back on my life so far, I'm grateful for the times I've pushed through tough situations and maintained a relatively organized life. But I know I can still do better, and that means no more engaging in activities that don't benefit me. Here's to a new chapter and a fresh start!

I'm determined to make the rest of the year my best yet! I want to enjoy my time more, connect with friends (even if I don't have many), and plan my days with purpose. Sure, I get excited and sometimes that energy can be overwhelming, but I won't let it stop me from pursuing my ideas, plans, and business goals. I'm taking control and making this my year.

Starting Afro Radio has been an incredible blessing this year, and I'm excited to continue growing and developing the brand. One venture I'm considering is starting a podcast - I love the way NPR formats their shows, and I'm also a big fan of the No Jumper Podcast for their unique style. I want to do everything I can to make Afro Radio even better, so stay tuned for updates and exciting new developments.

As I approach September, I hope I can reach to these realizations of a product where Afro Radio has a show and people can have a place to tune in. I am in the process of finding how that set up would be for my studio given the space I have. I am hoping by the begining of September I would know.
